# Hero
( [Repo](https://github.com/JaiChong/css385/tree/main/hero) / [Page](https://JaiChong.github.io/css385/hero) / [WebGL](https://JaiChong.github.io/css385/hero/webgl/))


## Description
I included the following extra features:
1. Press "Right-Click" in mouse-input mode to toggle Left-Click-to-Travel.
2. Press "K" to toggle enemy rotation and movement following the player, preceded by a timed enemy rotation animation.
3. Enemy collisions hurt the player, and the number of player deaths are recorded.
4. Respawn timer in which Hero is returned to center and locked out of movement, so it is clear the player died even if Hero is set to be following the mouse.
