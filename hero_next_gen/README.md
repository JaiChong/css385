# Next Generation Hero
( [Repo](https://github.com/JaiChong/css385/tree/main/hero_next_gen) / [Page](https://JaiChong.github.io/css385/hero_next_gen) / [WebGL](https://JaiChong.github.io/css385/hero_next_gen/webgl/))


## Description
I included the following extra features (grandfathered form Hero, so no extra credit):
1. Press "Right-Click" in mouse-input mode to toggle Left-Click-to-Travel.
2. Press "K" to toggle enemy targeting between sequential waypoints and the player.
3. Enemy collisions hurt the player, and the number of player deaths are recorded.
4. Respawn timer in which Hero is returned to center and locked out of movement, so it is clear the player died even if Hero is set to be following the mouse.
